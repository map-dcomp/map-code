This is not really documentation. It is just a bunch of notes.

For SASO:

+ Methods: 
++ see methodology folder for base topologies, scenario configs, ect.
++ all demand inputs was generated by demand tool. see points files for demand layouts. 
+++ all demand inputs should be feathered.
++ see .ods file and pngs in subfolders for demand curves, timing, and fault info.
++ client configs for "short" tests for subs.

+ Scenario Inputs:
++ see performance folder
++ see tolerance folder

+ Run framework:
++ see notes and scripts in framework folder



Misc fault generation notes from emails:

I hope you spend zero time on the spread sheet.

If you have already, the spread sheet isn't clear. The final tab is the most important and applies a set of random seeds into a set of uniformly fixed sized fault windows. The top half of the final sheet is the selected seeds. The bottom half is the math that applies the random seeds into the windows.

This is all a bit of a rats nest, mostly due to time constraints, but I choose to used the windowing + set seed approach to ensure we had reproducible  results first and a method for spreading faults across the run that was pretty easy to explain.

I'll use this data to annotate the gnuplot result set with the fault times for each line.

> f3 is 3 faults .. f9 is 9 faults. The topology for these runs is the single region with a Pm=.55 load.
>
> For each of N faults in a given test, the fault timing was randomly assigned into one of N windows between the time the run started at 120000ms and until the end of the run. The run end time varies depending upon the switching time assignment for the run. The seeds were selected, and applied into the windows following the timings in the attached spreadsheet. (This could be an appendix if needed, or just included in the experimental setup).
